**Access** : Available (on the internet) to all on demand


**Reuse/distribution** : Provided under terms that permit reuse and redistribution


**Transparency** : Providing information about data generation/collection


**Interoperability** : Interoperability with other data, machine readable formats


**Participation** : Everyone must be able to use, reuse and redistribute


**Equity** : Data is not truly open if the research process is not open to all

#Open Software

Software in which the copyright holder has granted a license to use, study, change, and/or distribute the source code.
https://opensource.org/definition

Sharing Software allows for 
- Scrutiny of methods / increased reproducibility
- Collaboration
- Credit

# Version control

Version control allows you to easily track changes, both your own changes as well as those made by collaborators (for example, Git)

By configuring your version control system to use GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket, you’ll have backups of every version

These platforms offer collaboration tools (issue tracker and project management tools), and you’ll be able to use third-party services such as code quality checkers, correctness checkers

# Why not supplemental materials?


---
# Why not supplemental materials? 

**Data control**: cannot be updated 

**Interoperability**: not available in all formats which makes it difficult to integrate and interact with the data

**Availability**: Difficult to access if the article is behind the paywall (supplemental materials are not included in the DOI and therefore the links can also break!)

**Impact**: Data should be a primary research output

**Publisher requirements**: Some publishers recommend using a data repository instead

Data/Software available in supplemental materials is not considered to be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Resuable)

|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Example       | Source code is in GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket with open license               | Source code deposited in Zenodo, Figshare or an institutional repository    | Jupyter Notebook in Binder, Capsule in CodeOcean, Docker or Singularity container, NextFlow workflow. Package for CRAN, PyPI, etc | Create an entry in a community registries e.g. ASCL (astronomy), CIG (geodynamics), RRID, swMath (mathematics). NLeSC RSD. | Publish software paper in JORS, JOSS, SoftwareX, etc. Publish executable research article in GigaByte | Many journals now accept papers about software – see  bit.ly/softwarejournals     |
| Advantages    | Discoverable Fits with development workflow No waiting before available       | Archived Persistent identifier and metadata Little/no wait before available | Enable direct reuse Can be given identifiers Makes available in location where users search                                       | Indexed Easier to find Often provides identifier May show citations                                                        | Easily citable Peer reviewed Can describe software design Easier for developers to write              | Easily citable Easier to reach target audience Understood by promotion committees |
| Disadvantages | Not archived Harder to cite Not easy to find if poorly described / documented | Direct software citations not accepted by all journals                      | Normally requires additional effort / resources                                                                                   | Not available in every domain Many people just Google, so must be indexed                                                  | Software not always archived Not as “prestigious” as domain-specific journal                          | Software generally not archived.
