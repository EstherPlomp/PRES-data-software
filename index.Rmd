# Open Data

A **Data Article** (also known as a Data Paper/Note/Release, or Database article) is a publication that is focused on the description of a dataset.

#Open Software

Software in which the copyright holder has granted a license to **use, study, change, and/or distribute the source code.** - [opensource.org](https://opensource.org/definition)

Sharing Software allows for 
- Scrutiny of methods / increased **reproducibility**
  - see [Krafczyk et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2020.0069) p5-11 for recommendations

# Version control

Version control allows you to **easily track changes**, both your own changes as well as those made by collaborators (for example, Git)

By configuring your version control system to use GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket, you’ll have **backups** of every version. Follow this [webinar for an introduction to GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRW8mlpTw5M). You can also use [TU Delft GitLab](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/).

These platforms offer **collaboration tools** (issue tracker and project management tools), and you’ll be able to use third-party **services** such as code quality checkers, correctness checkers.

# Getting a DOI for your GitHub Repository

Summary of this [guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)
1. Have a repository in mind that you’re creating the identifier for
1. Set up an account at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) (using your GitHub, email or [ORCID](https://orcid.org/))
1. Connect GitHub/Zenodo by authorizing Zenodo
1. On Zenodo, go to Settings -> GitHub, then toggle the button on for the repository that you want an identifier for
1. On GitHub: create a new release for your repository (snapshot that will be preserved on Zenodo)
1. On Zenodo: go to the Upload tab and add any additional information before publishing. 
1. On GitHub you can update your citation file with the DOI and add a DOI button in your Readme file

# If you’re reusing Software of others
- Have I **identified the software** which makes a significant and specialised contribution to my academic work?
- Have I checked if the software has a **recommended citation**?
  - If this is to a paper, have I also cited the software directly?
  - If there’s no recommended citation, have I **created as complete a citation as possible**?
      - Who created the software
      - When it was created
      - Title of the software (and version if available)
      - Where the software can be accessed

# Why not supplemental materials?

---
# Why not supplemental materials? 

**Data control**: cannot be updated 

**Interoperability**: not available in all formats which makes it difficult to integrate and interact with the data

**Availability**: Difficult to access if the article is behind the paywall (supplemental materials are not included in the DOI and therefore the links can also break!)

**Impact**: Data should be a primary research output

**Publisher requirements**: Some publishers recommend using a data repository instead

**Not FAIR**: Data/Software available in supplemental materials is not considered to be [FAIR](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-fair.html) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Resuable)
